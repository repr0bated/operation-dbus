# Branch Protection Status

## ✅ ACTIVE: Traditional Branch Protection

Your repository **does have branch protection** configured, but it's using the **traditional branch protection API** rather than the newer **rulesets API**.

### Active Protection on `master` Branch

```json
{
  "required_reviews": 1,
  "linear_history": true,
  "no_force_push": true,
  "no_deletions": true,
  "conversation_resolution": true
}
```

### Why No "Rulesets"?

The GitHub **Rulesets API** requires:
- GitHub Enterprise Cloud, OR
- Organization-level access, OR
- Specific GitHub features not available on personal accounts

**Your account:** Personal (User account, not organization)

### Check Active Protection

```bash
# View current protection
gh api repos/repr0bated/operation-dbus/branches/master/protection | jq

# Test by trying to force push (should fail)
git push origin master --force
```

### View in GitHub UI

1. Go to: https://github.com/repr0bated/operation-dbus/settings/branches
2. You'll see protection configured for `master`

### Difference

**Traditional Branch Protection** (what you have ✅):
- Configured via Settings → Branches
- Works on all GitHub accounts
- Limited to one branch at a time
- Uses older API endpoints

**Rulesets API** (what we tried ❌):
- Newer, more flexible system
- Requires Enterprise/Organization
- Can protect multiple branches with one ruleset
- More advanced features

### What This Means

Your `master` branch **IS protected**:
- ✅ Can't force push
- ✅ Can't delete branch
- ✅ Requires 1 approval
- ✅ Requires linear history
- ✅ Must resolve conversations

The protection is working - it's just not using the newer rulesets system.

### Verify It's Working

Try to force push (should fail):
```bash
git push origin master --force
# Expected: "remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed for refs/heads/master"
```

Try to create a PR without approval (should be blocked by GitHub UI).

### Next Steps

The protection is active and working. If you want the rulesets API features:
1. Upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Cloud, OR
2. Move repository to an organization account

But for your current needs, the traditional branch protection is fully functional!
